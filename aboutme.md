Hi, my name is Hojin Kim. <br>
I'm a PhD student at the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. <br>
I joined [ISCL(Interdisciplinary Scientific Computing Laboratory)](https://romit-maulik.github.io/index.html), and I am working with [Prof. Romit Maulik](https://romit-maulik.github.io/Members.html). <br>

<br>
My research interest is scientific machine learning (SciML), especially focusing on ***turbulence***.<br>

#### Education

Ph.D., Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, 2025.08 - Present <br>
Ph.D., Informatics, Penn State University, 2024.08 - 2025.8 <br>
M.S., Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, 2021.03 - 2023.02 <br>
B.S., Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, 2015.03 - 2021.02 <br>
(Served military service in Special Warfare School of ROK Army Special Force, 2016.03 - 2017.12)
