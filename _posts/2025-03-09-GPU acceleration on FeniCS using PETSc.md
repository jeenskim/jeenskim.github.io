_Will be updated soon..._

Let's say we are working on FEM simulation using FeniCS and want to solve a linear system as follows:

$Ax = b$.

When trying to accelerate this with _'Eigen'_ linear algebra backend and Cupy, 

The LHS matrix can be precomputed by using $assemble()$ and converted to CSR(Compact Sparse Row) format on a GPU.

However, the RHS matrix, $b$, should be computed using $assemble()$ and boundary conditon and converted to CSR format at each time step using CPU. 
This is becuase $assemble()$ function includes conducting integration on different meshes across domain and it is non-trivial to implement this function using CUDA kernel.
