### 1. Enabling ssh between Polaris Compute Nodes 
(<https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/known-issues/>)

1. `cd /home/[username]/.ssh`
2. `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
3. create authorized_keys file and copy id_rsa.pub into authorized_keys
4. Try setting up your .ssh/config file like this (swapping out the username placeholder with your ALCF username)

```
polaris-login-03:~> cat .ssh/config
Host *
User <YOUR_USERNAME>
Compression yes
Protocol 2
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p
ForwardAgent yes
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```
